Natural Language Processing Project: Yelp Review Classification

Overview

This project focuses on classifying Yelp reviews into 1-star or 5-star categories based on their textual content. We aim to leverage various NLP techniques to build a robust classification model using the Yelp Review Data Set.


Project Structure

The project is organized into several sections through the NLP pipeline, from data loading to model evaluation. Below is a brief overview of each section in the notebook:

1. Introduction
Objective: Classify Yelp reviews into 1-star or 5-star categories.
Dataset: Yelp Review Data Set.
Methodology: Use pipeline methods for a streamlined approach.

2. Data Loading and Preprocessing
Loading the Data: Import the Yelp reviews dataset.
Data Exploration: Examine the dataset for insights and cleaning requirements.
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop word removal, and vectorization.

3. Model Building
Pipeline Construction: Create a pipeline for text processing and model building.
Model Selection: Choose suitable models for classification, such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or Logistic Regression.

4. Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics: Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Confusion Matrix: Visualize the performance of the classification models.

5. Conclusion
Summary: Summarize findings and model performance.
